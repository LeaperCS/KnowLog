Parameters in the brackets indicate the address pool name and number of idle IP addresses.No IP address is available for allocation in the address pool. You can run thedisplay ip poolcommand to check the number of idle IP addresses. Here, the command output indicates that the number of idle IP addresses is 0.103DHCP IP POOL LOCKED(Pool name:name)The address pool is locked. The parameter in the brackets indicates the address pool name.The address pool is locked using thelockcommand in the address pool view.104NOT FIND IP POOL (Receive from interface:if, interface ip:ip. Relay ip:ip. Expect ip:ip)The address pool corresponding to the client-expected IP address is not found. Parameters in the brackets indicate the Layer 3 interface that receives the DHCP Request packet, IP address of the interface, IP address of the DHCP relay agent, and client-expected IP address.Possible cause 1:When a client is associated with an SSID, the client applies for an IP address in two-message exchange mode. That is, the client sends a DHCP Request packet carrying the expected IP address in Option50. The expected IP address is the address that the client has used before.If the client-expected IP address is on a different network segment from the client gateway address or the address pool corresponding to the client-expected IP address cannot be found, the DHCP server will fail to allocate this IP address. In this case, the DHCP server generates this log and returns a DHCP NAK packet to notify the client to apply for an IP address in four-message exchange mode, that is, the client sends a DHCP Discover packet to request for a new address.The network segment is changed when the client switches to another service VLAN.Possible cause 2:The DHCP server receives a DHCP Discover packet from the client. However, only thedhcp select globalcommand is run on the server and no corresponding address pool is created. As a result, the DHCP server generates this log and does not return any packet.This case rarely occurs.105INCORRECT REQUEST IP OR MAC (Ip:ipMAC:mac)The DHCP server cannot allocate the client-expected IP address. Parameters in the brackets indicate the client-expected IP address and client's MAC address.Possible cause 1:The DHCP server receives a DHCP Discover packet from the client. In the packet, the client-expected IP address is carried in Option50. When the client-expected IP address is not on the network segment of the address pool, the DHCP server generates this log and allocates a new IP address to the client.Possible cause 2:When a client is associated with an SSID, the client applies for an IP address in two-message exchange mode. That is, the client sends a DHCP Request packet carrying the expected IP address in Option50. The expected IP address is the address that the client has used before.If the client-expected IP address is within the address pool range but the address pool has no record about allocating any IP address to the client, the address pool does not respond to the request. The client waits till its request expires and begins to apply for a new IP address in four-message exchange mode.This log may be generated if the DHCP server restarts, IP address allocation records are manually cleared using thereset ip poolcommand, or a client exception occurs (for example, the client still uses an IP address after the address expires).106IP CONFLICTED(The conflict ip:ip)An IP address conflict occurs. The parameter in the brackets indicates the conflicted IP address.An IP address conflict is detected when the DHCP server allocates an IP address to a client. The address pool then sets the IP address status to conflicting and allocates a new IP address to the client.If the client-expected IP address is displayed as 255.255.255.255, the client does not expect any specific IP address."
